## Description
This repository contains 27 interview transcripts collected and analyzed for the 2025 Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 25) paper titled *Defining Privacy Engineering as a Profession*. 

The `interviews/` folder contains 27 files, each named using a unique identifier assigned to a specific participant (for instance, "P1" or "Participant 1"). Before viewing the dataset, we recommend reading the paper for an understanding of the research questions and interview protocol.

### Security/Privacy Issues and Ethical Concerns (All badges)
The dataset consists of transcripts with responses given by study participants. We took great care to ensure the confidentiality of the study participants. An institutional review board (IRB) at the University of California, Berkeley reviewed and approved the study protocol, including the analysis approach, data collection and retention practices, and the consent process. All participants provided their informed consent before we collected any personal information. 

All findings were rigorously de-identified and anonymized to ensure that disclosure of interviewee affiliations or reidentification of participants would be mitigated, thus mitigating potential harm upon public release of the redacted interview transcripts. 

Each transcript was manually analyzed and de-identified by multiple researchers in multiple sequential passes. We ensured that no facts or phrases that could serve as a way to identify the participant were mentioned. Identifiable facts and phrases were replaced with placeholders (e.g., [INSTITUTION], [LOCATION], [PROJECT] and so forth) and any responses from interviewees in which identifiable information was self-disclosed were fully redacted.

## Environment 
Each transcript is stored as a .txt file, which can be easily open by any text editing or word processing application. The overall size of the dataset is about 1.5 MB.
